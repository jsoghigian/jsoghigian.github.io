Welcome to John Soghigian's research website!

I'm an evolutionary ecologist broadly interested in the abundance and diversity of disease vectors.  I'm currently a postdocoral research scientist at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station.  I received my PhD in 2016 from Clark University, where I was advised by Todd Livdahl. The primary purpose of this website is to communicate my research interests, recent publications, and share some of the code I have generated for various projects.
