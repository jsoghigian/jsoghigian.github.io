Welcome to my research website! My name is John Soghigian, and I’m an evolutionary biologist interested in the causes and consequences of parasite and disease vector abundance and diversity. My research integrates genomics and evolutionary analyses with population biology to understand how evolutionary history influences contemporary distributions of insects of medical and veterinary importance. 

In the summer of 2021, I'll be joining the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Calgary as an Assistant Professor.  As of now, I’m currently a postdocoral research scientist in the Department of Entomology and Plant Pathology at North Carolina State University, where I am working on understanding the origin of important parasite and vector phenotypes. I received my PhD in 2016 from Clark University, where I was advised by Todd Livdahl. The primary purpose of this website is to communicate my research interests, recent publications, and share some of the code I have generated for various projects.
