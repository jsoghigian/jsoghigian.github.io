Welcome to my research website!  My name is John Soghigian, and I'm an evolutionary ecologist broadly interested in the causes and consequences of disease vector abundance and diversity.  I integrate evolutionary analyses, population ecology, and genomics to understand dynamics that influence contemporary vector distributions and ecology.  I'm currently a postdocoral research scientist at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station.  I received my PhD in 2016 from Clark University, where I was advised by Todd Livdahl. The primary purpose of this website is to communicate my research interests, recent publications, and share some of the code I have generated for various projects.
