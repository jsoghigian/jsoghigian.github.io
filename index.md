Welcome to my research website! My name is John Soghigian, and I’m an evolutionary biologist broadly interested in the causes and consequences of disease vector abundance and diversity. My research integrates genomics, ecology, and evolutionary analyses with population biology to understand how evolutionary history that influences contemporary vector distributions. 

I’m currently a postdocoral research scientist in the Department of Entomology and Plant Pathology at North Carolina State University, where I am working on discerning the mosquito ‘tree of life.’ I received my PhD in 2016 from Clark University, where I was advised by Todd Livdahl. The primary purpose of this website is to communicate my research interests, recent publications, and share some of the code I have generated for various projects.
