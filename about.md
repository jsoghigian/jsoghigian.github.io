I'm an evolutionary ecologist that enjoys both education and research. I have a passion for creating and consuming knowledge, and I love to share my interests in evolution and ecology with others.  Most of my studies are focused on mosquitoes, but unlike many entomologists, I don't study mosquitoes because I _like_ them.  I respect their immense public health consequence, and believe they offer an excellent system to evaluate hypotheses in ecology and evolution.  Moreover, I think that due to their obvious relevance, they make particularly useful tools for engaing undergraduates, both in the classroom, and in the lab.

As a graduate student, I had the opportunity to engage in a variety of mentorship activities, from those within the classroom, to supervising undergraduate and Masters students undertaking independent projects.  It was in this role as a faciltator for scientific inquiry that I felt the most rewarded, and I have been lucky enough to mentor several masters students and more than a dozen undergraduates.  I have always felt that a key role of a scientist was to create informed citizens, but in graduate school I learned that there is so much more to being an educator than just teaching.  By cultivating an appreciation and love for the natural world and science, I hope to inspire students to pursue careers in STEM fields.  You can read more about my itnerest in teaching in my Teaching Resources section.

Outside of academia, I enjoy the outdoors and am an avid hiker, camper, and canoer.  Over the last three summers I have been lucky enough to take trips to northern Minnesota in the Boundary Waters Wilderness Area and to Yosemite National Park in California - where, incidentally, I found mosquito larvae at 10,700'... But I avoided the temptation to collect them!
