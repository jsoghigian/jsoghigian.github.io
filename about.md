I'm an evolutionary ecologist with a passion for research and education. I have a passion for creating and consuming knowledge, and I love to share my interests in evolution and ecology with others.  Most of my studies are focused on mosquitoes, but unlike many entomologists, I don't study mosquitoes because I like them.  I respect their immense public health consequence, and believe they offer an excellent system to evaluate hypotheses in ecology and evolution.

As a graduate student, I had the opportunity to engage in a variety of mentorship activities, from those within the classroom, to supervising undergraduate and Masters students undertaking independent projects.  It was in this role as a faciltator for discovery that I felt the most rewarded.

Outside of academia, I enjoy the outdoors and am an avid hiker and camper.
