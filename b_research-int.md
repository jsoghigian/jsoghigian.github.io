Thus, my research spans experimental ecology, molecular ecology, and macroevolutionary hypothesis testing. Most often, my research questions involve container-dwelling mosquitoes.  Container-dwelling mosquitoes utilize natural or domestic temporary water containers, such as water-filled plant parts or buckets. These mosquitoes are of critical importance, as they are some of the world's deadliest disease vectors, and among the most successful invasive species in history.  Mosquitoes such as *Aedes albopictus*, shown above, have been transported globally due to human trade.

<img align="left" src="https://github.com/jsoghigian/jsoghigian.github.io/blob/master/asco_bar.jpg?raw=true" style="padding:5px;" border="3"> My research frequent involves *Ascogregarina*, a genus of parasites found exclusively in container mosquitoes, and characterizing their interactions with their container dwelling mosquito hosts..  *Ascogregarina* develop entirely in larval phases of the mosquito and are ubiqutous with hosts.  *Ascogregarina barretti*, a species of *Ascogregarina *that infects *Aedes triseriatus*, is shown at left.  I have recently shown these parasites respond to host sex and utilize different dispersal strategies depending on the sex of the host they are infecting[^1].  With L. Valsdottir, we showed that gregarines are not always detrimental to hosts, as infected _Aedes triseriatus_ survive longer in the presence of the predatory _Toxorhynchites rutilus_ than do uninfected larvae, suggesting a higher order interaction[^2].  Moreover, parasite infection altered larval mosquito behavior by increasing foraging and decreasing energetically costly movement (thrashing). With future research, I hope to elucidate if this interaction is significant enough to grant the parasite fitness benefits, as well as asses potential parasite effects on adult mosquitoes.  All of this gregarine work was conducted under the supervision, and with immense help, from T. Livdahl.  
  
More recently, I have had the opportunity to develop additional skills with molecular ecology and genomics.  More will come here soon.
