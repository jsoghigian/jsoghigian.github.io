Most often, my research questions involve container-dwelling mosquitoes.  Container-dwelling mosquitoes utilize natural or domestic temporary water containers for immature stages, such as water-filled plant parts or buckets, in contrast to mosquitoes that utilize larger bodies of water, such as flood plains, vernal pools, or swaps. Container-dwelling mosquitoes are of critical importance, as they are some of the world's deadliest disease vectors, and among the most successful global invasive species.  Mosquitoes such as *Aedes albopictus*, shown above, have been transported globally due to human trade.  

As container habitats make excellent replicates in ecology, much of my dissertation focused on utilizing containers - both naturally occuring containers and experimental microcosm in the lab - to test important hypotheses in disease ecology.  A great deal of this research utilized  *Ascogregarina*, a genus of parasites found exclusively in container mosquitoes. <img align="left" src="https://github.com/jsoghigian/jsoghigian.github.io/blob/master/asco_bar.jpg?raw=true" style="border:2px solid black;margin:5px 5px 5px 5px">  Much of my dissertation involved characterizing their interactions with host mosquitoes, and some of this research has been [recently published](https://jsoghigian.github.io/publications/). *Ascogregarina* develop entirely in larval phases of the mosquito and are ubiqutous with hosts, making them easy to culture in the lab and use as experimental treatments in microcosms.  *Ascogregarina barretti*, a species of *Ascogregarina* that infects *Aedes triseriatus*, is shown at left.  

I am also more generally interested in macroevolution, biogeography, and timing of diversification events in mosquito lineages.  Surprisingly, there exists no species level phylogeny of this important group, and to date, the most expansive published phylogenies have included only dozens of taxa.  Such limited taxonomic sampling prohibts robust hypothesis testing and limits conclusions that can be drawn, when so little is understood about the evolutionary relationships of mosquitoes, and current nomenclature is largely based around characters convenient for differential identification, and not necessarily monophyly.  Thus, I have become interested in better sampling the mosquito tree of life.  Recently, I utilized a densely sampled phylogeny of the Aedini, and previously published morphological and habitat data, to show that container specialization has arisen multiple times in the Aedini, from a ground pool associated phenotype. 



CUT: I have recently shown these parasites respond to host sex and utilize different dispersal strategies depending on the sex of the host they are infecting[^1].  With L. Valsdottir, we showed that the interaction between host and parasite can be complicated by the presence of a predator, as infected _Aedes triseriatus_ survive longer in the presence of the predatory _Toxorhynchites rutilus_ than do uninfected larvae, suggesting a higher order interaction[^2]. 

Containers are excellent replicates in experimental ecology, and allow for the testing of hypotheses using constituents of container communities. My research frequently involves *Ascogregarina*, a genus of parasites found exclusively in container mosquitoes.  Much of my dissertation involved characterizing their interactions with host mosquitoes. *Ascogregarina* develop entirely in larval phases of the mosquito and are ubiqutous with hosts, making them easy to culture in the lab and use as experimental treatments in microcosms.  <img align="left" src="https://github.com/jsoghigian/jsoghigian.github.io/blob/master/asco_bar.jpg?raw=true" style="border:2px solid black;margin:5px 5px 5px 5px"> *Ascogregarina barretti*, a species of *Ascogregarina* that infects *Aedes triseriatus*, is shown at left.

Moreover, parasite infection altered larval mosquito behavior by increasing foraging and decreasing energetically costly movement (thrashing). In the future, I hope to continue to utilize gregarines as a tool
