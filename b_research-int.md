Thus, my research spans experimental ecology, molecular ecology, and macroevolutionary hypothesis testing. Most often, my research questions involve container-dwelling mosquitoes.  Container-dwelling mosquitoes utilize natural or domestic temporary water containers, such as water-filled plant parts or buckets. These mosquitoes are of critical importance, as they are some of the world's deadliest disease vectors, and among the most successful invasive species in history.  Mosquitoes such as *Aedes albopictus*, shown above, have been transported globally due to human trade.  As container habitats make excellent replicates in ecology, much of my dissertation focused on utilizing containers - both naturally occuring containers and experimental microcosm in the lab - to test important hypotheses in disease ecology.  A great deal of this research utilized  *Ascogregarina*, a genus of parasites found exclusively in container mosquitoes.  Much of my dissertation involved characterizing their interactions with host mosquitoes. *Ascogregarina* develop entirely in larval phases of the mosquito and are ubiqutous with hosts, making them easy to culture in the lab and use as experimental treatments in microcosms.  <img align="left" src="https://github.com/jsoghigian/jsoghigian.github.io/blob/master/asco_bar.jpg?raw=true" style="border:2px solid black;margin:5px 5px 5px 5px"> *Ascogregarina barretti*, a species of *Ascogregarina* that infects *Aedes triseriatus*, is shown at left.  

CUT: I have recently shown these parasites respond to host sex and utilize different dispersal strategies depending on the sex of the host they are infecting[^1].  With L. Valsdottir, we showed that the interaction between host and parasite can be complicated by the presence of a predator, as infected _Aedes triseriatus_ survive longer in the presence of the predatory _Toxorhynchites rutilus_ than do uninfected larvae, suggesting a higher order interaction[^2].

Moreover, parasite infection altered larval mosquito behavior by increasing foraging and decreasing energetically costly movement (thrashing). In the future, I hope to continue to utilize gregarines as a tool  
  
Container habitats are extremely important, as larvae CONVERGENCE WORK GOES HERE.
