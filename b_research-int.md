Most often, my research questions involve container-dwelling mosquitoes.  Container-dwelling mosquitoes utilize natural or domestic temporary water containers for immature stages, such as water-filled plant parts or buckets, in contrast to mosquitoes that utilize larger bodies of water, such as flood plains, vernal pools, or swaps. Container-dwelling mosquitoes are of critical importance, as they are some of the world's deadliest disease vectors, and among the most successful global invasive species.  Mosquitoes such as *Aedes albopictus*, shown above, have been transported globally due to human trade.

A great deal of this research utilized  *Ascogregarina*, a genus of parasites found exclusively in container mosquitoes.  Much of my dissertation involved characterizing their interactions with host mosquitoes, and some of this research has been [recently published](https://jsoghigian.github.io/publications/). *Ascogregarina* develop entirely in larval phases of the mosquito and are ubiqutous with hosts, making them easy to culture in the lab and use as experimental treatments in microcosms.  *Ascogregarina barretti*, a species of *Ascogregarina* that infects *Aedes triseriatus*, is shown at left.  

The majority of mosquito species are specialized to specific types of blood hosts, with many genera 'specializing' on a class of animal host.  Some species of disease vectors may feed predominantly on one class of bloodhosts, but occasionally, populations exhibit variability in feeding patterns that are not related to abundance of bloodhosts.  This is the case with *Culiseta melanura*, the primary vector of Eastern Equine Encephalitis virus (EEE) and the focus of a research project I have undertaken at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station. EEE is a rare but extremely deadly vector borne disease, which until recently, occurred in sporadic outbreaks in isolated focal locations.  Since 2003, virus activity in mosquito populations has greatly expanded, and New Hampshire, Connecticut, Vermont, and Maine have all reported their first human cases of the virus ever. Using genomic methods, I am characterizing the population structure of this vector across the eastern United States.

I am also more generally interested in macroevolution, speciation, biogeography, and timing of diversification events in mosquito lineages.   Surprisingly, there exists no species level phylogeny of this important group, and to date, the most expansive published phylogenies have included only dozens of taxa.   Such limited taxonomic sampling prohibts robust testing of macroevolutionary hypotheses related to host and pathogen associations across lineages.  Current nomenclature is largely based around characters convenient for differential identification that are not necessarily representative of monophyletic lineages. Thus, I have become interested in better sampling the mosquito tree of life.  Recently, I utilized a densely sampled phylogeny of the Aedini, and previously published morphological and habitat data, to show that a phenotype associated with container specialization has arisen multiple times in the Aedini, from a ground pool associated phenotype. Importantly, my results suggest that: **1**: Invasive *Aedes* are not monophyletic, and invasive container breeding mosquitoes are present in multiple lineages separated by millions of years, and **2**: Container breeding mosquitoes share a suite of convergent characters, plausibly attributed to adaptation to larval habitat.
