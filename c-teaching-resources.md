I feel very fortunate to have had the opportunity to serve as a teaching assistant for twelve laboratory sections in six courses and to be the instructor of record for Instructory Biostatistics (BIOL106, Spring 2015) during my time as a doctoral student at Clark University. I strive to engage students and develop critical thinking skills, regardless of course topic.  I was awarded the Outstanding Teaching Assistant Award for 2013-2014 by Clark University, an accomplishment I take great pride in. 

I gained some experience in the pedagogy of teaching through a Seminar in College Teaching, offered by Worcester State University, which greatly aided me in preparing my own course.  As part of the course requirements, I completed a teaching portfolio, which is still online [here](https://sites.google.com/site/jssteaching/home).  The course I proposed to teach for this portfolio was an enormous success, and I received an overall instructor rating on student evaluations of 4.5 out of 5 and numerous positive comments related to my structured style and utilization of real world examples.
