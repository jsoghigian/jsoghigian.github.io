I have accepted an offer to join the University of Calgary's College of Veterinary Medicine as an Assistant Professor of Parasitology.  I'll be starting my first lab on the evolution of parasite and vector species, with a particular emphasis on flies of medical and veterinary importance.  My lab will have a strong focus on genomics, utilizing modern methods to understand the evolution of important vector and parasite phenotypes.

My new lab will immediately be recruiting postdocs and graduate students; keep your eyes peeled for official announcements soon, but feel to reach out to me in the meantime!

In addition, I'll likely retire this site and move to a new site focused on the lab.  Stay tuned!
