A dwarf tick I [recently described](https://academic.oup.com/jme/article/3859660/The-First-Evidence-of-Nanism-in-Ixodes-Ixodes) has made me famous... on [the blog of Entomology Today](https://entomologytoday.org/2017/06/07/first-report-of-dwarf-deer-tick-comes-as-overall-population-soars/), anyway.

The state Tick Testing Program at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station recently received an abnormally small tick, pictured above.  The tick was not originally gold, but was sputter-coated for electron microscopy.  After a bit of basic molecular work, along with the aforementioned microscopy that highlighted morphology consistent with an adult female despite a small size, I identified the tick as *Ixodes scapularis*.  This is the smallest adult deer tick found in Connecticut and probably the country.
