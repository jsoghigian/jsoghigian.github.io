  <span style=""> Phylogenetic analysis of variance R code</span>

As part of my analysis finding convergent evolution in container specialization in the genus *Aedes*, I wrote a wrapper script that would perform phylogenetically-informed analysis of variance given several models of evolution.


##### Semiautomated alignment of universal single copy orthologs

ToCome, a set of scripts that automagically compares and aligns single copy orthologs for a set of [BUSCO analyses](http://busco.ezlab.org/), then outputs a formatted nexus file with a partition scheme that can be used in downstream analyses.
