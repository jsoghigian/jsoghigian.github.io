I will use this section to provide snipets of code or files to download that have been part of my various analyses.

  <span style=""> Phylogenetic analysis of variance R code</span>
</div>
As part of my analysis finding convergent evolution in container specialization in the genus *Aedes*, I wrote a wrapper script that would perform phylogenetically-informed analysis of variance given several models of evolution.

  <span style=""> USCO Align</span>
</div>

A set of scripts that take a list of results directories from [BUSCO analyses](http://busco.ezlab.org/), finds orthologs present in all analyses, outputs all shared orthologs, aligns all orthologs, and outputs a concatenated multisequence alignment file in Phylip and Nexus formats, with a RAxML partition file and Nexus in file partition scheme.
