Fundamentally, my research is interested in uncovering insight into the abundance and diversity of disease vectors through methods in ecology and evolution. Most often, my research questions involve container-dwelling mosquitoes.  Container-dwelling mosquitoes utilize natural or domestic temporary water containers, such as water-filled plant parts or buckets. These mosquitoes are of critical importance, as they are some of the world's deadliest disease vectors, and among the most successful invasive species in history.  Mosquitoes such as *Aedes aegypti* and *Aedes albopictus* have been transported globally due to human trade.

I'm also interested in *Ascogregarina*, a genus of parasites found exclusively in container mosquitoes.  *Ascogregarina* develop entirely in larval phases of the mosquito and are ubiqutous with hosts.  I've have recently shown these parasites respond to host sex and utilize different dispersal strategies depending on the sex of the host they are infecting.
